# Green Monkeys Handmade App
## An iOS App for Artisan Collectives
One of the main reasons that Artisans are unable to get themselves listed on Amazon's Handmade store is the requirement for a bank account. Now, artisans can form collectives or enter with existing ones to get their products listed on Handmade. This opens up a wealth of new opportunities for artisans located in remote or rural areas without the need for a bank account or consistent connection to the web.
